                        Explained briefly, scuba diving is a water sport that involves breathing air from a tank while
                        underwater.
                        Scuba
                        is an acronym for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.

                        Most scuba divers are recreational divers who explore underwater environments such as lakes,
                        rivers,
                        quarries,
                        kelp forests and coral reefs. There are also people who scuba dive for work including public
                        safety divers,
                        marine biologists and many others.

                        There's more to scuba diving than just strapping a tank on your back and jumping in the water.
                        It all starts
                        with a dive plan.

                        You might choose the dive site and invite friends, or a dive buddy might message you,
                        “conditions are going
                        to be great this weekend!” Either way, your plan should include diving with at least one other
                        person in
                        case anything goes wrong underwater. If you don't have a dive buddy, the local dive shop can
                        help you find
                        one.

                        Once you decide where you want to dive and for how long, you'll choose the appropriate scuba
                        equipment. For
                        example:

                        If you plan to make multiple dives, you'll want extra scuba tanks.
                        When diving in cold water, many divers wear a dry suit instead of a wetsuit to stay warm.
                        If the dive site is a shore dive, you may need a dive float.
                        Many divers own their own scuba gear and either rent tanks or get their tanks filled at a local
                        shop. Others
                        rent all their diving equipment. Watch this video to learn more about how scuba gear works.

                        When the dive day arrives, you'll check the dive conditions one more time. If everything looks
                        good, you'll
                        head to the dock or dive site with your gear.

                        It's hard to explain what scuba diving feels like. The best way to find out is to try it for
                        yourself. If
                        you're not ready to enroll in a scuba certification class, try a Discover Scuba Diving®
                        Experience. In a
                        pool or calm water environment, you'll take your first breaths underwater under the guidance of
                        a PADI Scuba
                        Instructor or Divemaster.

                        A Discover Scuba Experience allows you to try scuba diving under the guidance of a dive
                        professional, but if
                        you want to dive independently with your friends, you'll need a scuba certification. In a scuba
                        certification course, you learn basic scuba skills, safety procedures and other essentials.
